# 5G-all-in-one Helm

***5G-all-in-one-helm*** is an open-source project implemented to provide helm charts in order deploy on one click a 5G system (RAN+SA 5G core) without using meta cni plugins like multus, that is, exclusively on top of one kubernetes network plugin, like Calico.  It currently relies on Free5GC  for the core  network and UERANSIM and MY5G-RANTester to simulate Radio Access Network.
